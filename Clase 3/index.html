        <h2>Earth's cousins: Upcoming missions to look for 'biosignatures' in exoplanet atmospheres</h2>

        <p> Scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets, including dozens of terrestrial—or rocky—worlds in the habitable zones around their parent stars. A promising approach to search for signs of life on these worlds is to probe exoplanet atmospheres
            for "biosignatures"—quirks in chemical composition that are telltale signs of life. For example, thanks to photosynthesis, our atmosphere is nearly 21% oxygen, a much higher level than expected given Earth's composition, orbit and parent star.
            <br /> <br /> Finding biosignatures is no straightforward task. Scientists use data about how exoplanet atmospheres interact with light from their parent star to learn about their atmospheres. But the information, or spectra, that they can
            gather using today's ground- and space-based telescopes is too limited to measure atmospheres directly or detect biosignatures. <br /> <br /> Exoplanet researchers such as Victoria Meadows, a professor of astronomy at the University of Washington,
            are focused on what forthcoming observatories, like the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, could measure in exoplanet atmospheres. On Feb. 15 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in Seattle, Meadows,
            a principal investigator of the UW's Virtual Planetary Laboratory, will deliver a talk to summarize what kind of data these new observatories can collect and what they can reveal about the atmospheres of terrestrial, Earth-like exoplanets.
            Meadows sat down with UW News to discuss the promise of these new missions to help us view exoplanets in a new light.

            <p>Oxygen alone is not a biosignature. It depends on its levels and what else is in the atmosphere. You could have an oxygen-rich atmosphere from the loss of an ocean, for example: Light splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen
                escapes into space, and oxygen builds up into the atmosphere. </p>

            <p>" In the next five to 10 years, we'll potentially get our first chance to observe the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. This is because new observatories are set to come online, including the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based
                observatories like the Extremely Large Telescope. A lot of our recent work at the Virtual Planetary Laboratory, as well as by colleagues at other institutions, has focused on simulating what Earth-like exoplanets will "look" like to the
                JWST and ground-based telescopes. That allows us to understand the spectra that these telescopes will pick up, and what those data will and won't tell us about those exoplanet atmospheres. "
